**Kaleido Cross Platform Library**
Kaleido is an open-source cross-platform library designed for generating static images (e.g., png, svg, pdf, etc.) for web-based visualization libraries with a focus on reducing external dependencies. 

The initial focus of the project is exporting images from plotly.js in Python for use by plotly.py, but it has been designed to be easily extensible to other web-based visualization libraries and programming languages.

The primary focus of Kaleido (at least initially) is to serve as a dependency for web-based visualization libraries such as plotly.py. As such, the focus is on providing a programmatic API rather than a user-friendly one.

Kaleido is a powerful library that makes it easy to generate static images from web-based visualization libraries. Its focus on reducing external dependencies and providing a programmatic API make it an excellent choice for generating reports and other visualizations.
